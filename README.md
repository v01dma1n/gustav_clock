# Gustav VFD Clock

A 12-digit VFD (Vacuum Fluorescent Display) clock based on the ESP32. It features automatic NTP time synchronization, weather display from OpenWeatherMap, and a web-based configuration portal. This project is built using the `ESP32NTPClock` library framework.

## ✨ Features

  * **12-Digit VFD Display:** Driven by a MAX6921 chip over SPI.
  * **Automatic Time Sync:** Connects to your WiFi and synchronizes its time from an NTP server.
  * **Weather Display:** Fetches and displays the current temperature and humidity for a configured location from OpenWeatherMap.
  * **Animated Scenes:** Cycles through displaying the time, date, and weather using a playlist of customizable animations (Slot Machine, Scrolling, Matrix).
  * **Web Configuration:** On first boot or when WiFi fails, the clock enters an Access Point (AP) mode. You can connect to its WiFi network to configure all settings through a web page on your phone or computer.
  * **Double-Reset:** Manually enter the AP configuration mode at any time by quickly resetting the device twice.
  * **Real-Time Clock (RTC):** Uses a DS1307 RTC module to keep time when offline and to enable the double-reset feature.

## ⚙️ Hardware Required

  * **ESP32 Module:** An ESP32-WROOM-DA was used in development.
  * **VFD Display:** A 12-digit Vacuum Fluorescent Display.
  * **VFD Driver:** A MAX6921 driver chip.
  * **RTC Module:** A DS1307 Real-Time Clock module with a backup battery.
  * **Power Supply:** A stable 5V power supply capable of powering the ESP32 and the VFD.

## 🛠️ Configuration

1.  **First Boot:** On the very first boot, the clock will not have WiFi credentials. It will automatically start in Access Point (AP) mode. The display will show a message like "SETUP MODE...".
2.  **Connect to the AP:** Using your phone or computer, connect to the WiFi network named **`gustav-clock`**.
3.  **Captive Portal:** Once connected, a captive portal should automatically open. If it doesn't, navigate to **`192.168.4.1`** in your web browser.
4.  **Enter Settings:** Fill in your WiFi SSID and password, your [POSIX timezone string](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://www.timezoneconverter.com/cgi-bin/posix.tz.pl), and your OpenWeatherMap API key and location.
5.  **Save:** Click "Save and Restart." The clock will reboot and connect to your WiFi.

To re-enter configuration mode at any time, simply press the **reset button twice** in quick succession (about 1-2 seconds apart).
